   "Making it. Can you see it? Yes. Good. This is actually me making the I'm not good at life face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California where I did my PhD on Why we're better in games than we are in real life? And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have, we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. And I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds, but I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters, inspired to collaborate and work together towards a common goal. And I think that's a big part of what's missing in our society today, is that sense of purpose and meaning that we get from playing games, and we need to find ways to bring that into our everyday lives."

I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here, but even in this limited view, it's already giving us a sense of the scope and the diversity of the information that's available. And what's really interesting is that this format, this visual representation, it's not just a summary, it's also a way to navigate and explore the information. You can start to see patterns and relationships between different topics, and you can start to see the connections between different areas of knowledge. So, it's not just a summary, it's a way to understand the structure and the organization of the information, and that's what I think is really powerful."
