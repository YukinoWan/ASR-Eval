  "output": "The most likely explanation for feeling dizzy after sitting in front of a laptop for an hour or two is that you may be experiencing symptoms of computer vision syndrome (CVS). This can include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, eye strain, and neck pain.\n\nOne possible reason for this is that the constant glare from the screen can cause your eyes to work harder to focus on the images on the screen, leading to discomfort and fatigue. Additionally, the stillness required while using a computer can cause your muscles in your eyes, head, and neck to become stiff and tense, which can also contribute to dizziness.\n\nTo alleviate these symptoms, it's recommended to take frequent breaks to rest your eyes and stretch your body. You can try looking away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and focusing on something in the distance. It's also important to maintain good posture while using a computer, with your feet flat on the ground, your back straight, and your shoulders relaxed.\n\nIf you continue to experience symptoms despite taking these precautions, it's always a good idea to consult with an eye doctor or medical professional for further evaluation.",
