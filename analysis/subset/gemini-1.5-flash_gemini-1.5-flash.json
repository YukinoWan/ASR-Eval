This is especially true if the dizziness is severe or frequent.\n\n* **Low blood sugar:**  If you haven't eaten recently, low blood sugar can cause dizziness.\n\n* **Medication side effects:** Some medications can list dizziness as a side effect.\n\n\nTo help determine the cause, consider:\n\n* **How often does it happen?**  Is it every time you sit at your laptop for a while, or is it occasional?\n* **How long does the dizziness last?**\n* **Do you have any other symptoms?** (headache, nausea, blurred vision, etc.)\n* **What is your general health like?**\n\n\nIf the dizziness is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.
