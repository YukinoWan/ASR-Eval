Let me help you with the translation.\n\nThe phrase \"Mae'n ddod i chi\" roughly translates to \"It's coming to you\". The repetition of \"Mae'n ddod i'r ddod i'r ddod...\" is a bit confusing, but it seems to be a play on words, with \"ddod\" meaning \"to come\" or \"to arrive\". It's possible that the speaker is trying to convey a sense of something or someone arriving or approaching, but the repetition makes it difficult to understand the intended meaning.\n\nIf you can provide more context or information about the audio, I may be able to help you better.",

One possibility is that you might be experiencing a condition called \"screen-induced dizziness\" or \"screen fatigue.\" This can occur when you're focusing on a screen for an extended period, and your brain gets overwhelmed by the visual stimuli.\n\nAnother possibility is that you might be experiencing a lack of oxygen flow to your brain. When you're sitting for a long time, your blood flow can become sluggish, which can lead to dizziness and lightheadedness.\n\nIt's also possible that you're experiencing a combination of both of these factors, or something entirely different. If you're concerned about your dizziness, I would recommend taking regular breaks to stretch, move around, and get some fresh air. You might also consider adjusting the brightness and contrast of your screen, and taking breaks to look away from the screen every 20-30 minutes to give your eyes a rest.\n\nDo any of these possibilities sound like they might be contributing to your dizziness?",
