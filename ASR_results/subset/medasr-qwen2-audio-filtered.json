   "It sounds like you may have a cold or other type of respiratory infection. It's common for the symptoms of these types of infections to improve at night, but then to worsen again when you exercise. This could be due to a number of factors, including changes in temperature and humidity, increased physical activity, and the release of certain chemicals during exercise that can irritate the airways.\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can perform a physical examination and determine the cause of your symptoms, and recommend appropriate treatment options. In the meantime, it's a good idea to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and avoid any activities that may aggravate your symptoms."

   "I'm struggling to bear weight on my knee when I stand straight, I feel and hear a loud popping noise.\n\nThis description suggests that you may be experiencing a condition known as patellar tendinitis or a dislocation of your kneecap. Patellar tendinitis is an inflammation or irritation of the patellar tendon, which connects the kneecap to the shin bone. It can cause pain, stiffness, and a popping sound when you bend or straighten your knee. A dislocation of the kneecap occurs when the kneecap moves out of its normal position, which can also cause pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the knee.\n\nIt's important to seek medical attention for these conditions to properly diagnose and treat them. In the meantime, it's best to avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms and consider using ice or heat therapy to alleviate any pain or discomfort."

   "The most likely explanation for feeling dizzy after sitting in front of a laptop for an hour or two is that you may be experiencing symptoms of computer vision syndrome (CVS). This can include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, eye strain, and neck pain.\n\nOne possible reason for this is that the constant glare from the screen can cause your eyes to work harder to focus on the images on the screen, leading to discomfort and fatigue. Additionally, the stillness required while using a computer can cause your muscles in your eyes, head, and neck to become stiff and tense, which can also contribute to dizziness.\n\nTo alleviate these symptoms, it's recommended to take frequent breaks to rest your eyes and stretch your body. You can try looking away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and focusing on something in the distance. It's also important to maintain good posture while using a computer, with your feet flat on the ground, your back straight, and your shoulders relaxed.\n\nIf you continue to experience symptoms despite taking these precautions, it's always a good idea to consult with an eye doctor or medical professional for further evaluation."
