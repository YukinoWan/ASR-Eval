This doesn't perfectly align with typical stock market behavior.\n* **(D) Inflation rates:** Inflation rates also fluctuate, and bringing inflation down to zero is a common economic goal.  However, the language of \"rapidly rising\" and needing to \"fall all the way to zero\" is more extreme than typical inflation discussions.
