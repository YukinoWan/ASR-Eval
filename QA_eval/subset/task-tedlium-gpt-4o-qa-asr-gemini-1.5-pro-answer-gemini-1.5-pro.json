Therefore the best answer is **[[E]]** as the audio does not explicitly confirm any of the other choices.\n",

     "The audio says \"one pill twice a day is *not* as good as three pills\".  This implies three pills (presumably spread out during the day in some way) is better.

The audio never mentions one pill once a day or one pill three times a day, ruling out (A) and (B). The audio does say three pills is better than one pill twice a day, suggesting three pills in some fashion is better, but it does not specifically say three pills at once.\n\nSince the question asks how often for *better* effectiveness, the implication of three pills being better than one twice a day makes the choice of \"three pills at once\" plausible but not certain. Since the question asks for better effectiveness rather than simply matching a stated dosage,  we can eliminate (C).\n\nGiven the audio does not state the better dosage clearly, the correct answer is [[E]].\n",
