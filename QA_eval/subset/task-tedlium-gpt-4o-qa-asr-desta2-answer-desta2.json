   "I'd be happy to help you with that! It sounds like your daughter had an issue with eyebrow threading, which can sometimes cause irritation or even infection. The \"opening of skin\" you mentioned is likely a small wound or incision that can become inflamed and ooze pus.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help your daughter take care of the area:\n\n1. Clean the area gently with soap and water: Use a mild soap and lukewarm water to clean the affected area. Pat it dry with a clean towel.\n2. Apply an antibiotic ointment: Over-the-counter antibiotic ointments like Neosporin or Bacitracin can help prevent infection and promote healing.\n3. Keep it covered: Cover the area with a bandage or gauze to prevent bacteria from entering the wound and causing infection.\n4. Avoid picking or scratching: Resist the temptation to pick or scratch the area, as this can lead to further irritation, infection, and scarring.\n5. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye out for signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, consult a doctor.\n\nIt's also a good idea to consult a doctor or dermatologist for further guidance on how to care for the wound and prevent infection. They may prescribe antibiotics or provide additional advice on how to promote healing.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."

He's been trying to keep it clean and dry, but it just won't stop leaking. I'm getting a little worried too, because I don't know what it could be. Have you ever heard of anything like this before? Do you have any ideas what it could be? We've tried putting a topical cream on it, but it doesn't seem to be helping. We're getting a little desperate for some answers.
