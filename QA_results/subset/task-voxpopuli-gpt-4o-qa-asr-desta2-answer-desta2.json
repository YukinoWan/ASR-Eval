The speaker seems to be talking about the way forward, and translations could be an important part of that process.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n(B) General translations\n\nPlease note that I'm not 100% confident in my answer, as the audio is quite difficult to decipher, and I may have misinterpreted the speaker's words.",
